Is your credit score high enough to buy a home?

There are many misconceptions floating around out there about this very topic. Recently, it was reported that 24% of renters believe that they need a score of 780 to 800 just to be considered for a mortgage, but that’s false. In reality, only 25% of all Americans have a FICO score between 740 and 800.&nbsp;

The truth is, just because you have a low credit score doesn’t mean you can’t purchase a home. **There are many loan programs out there with low or no credit requirements.&nbsp;**

For example, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) requires a minimum FICO score of just 580. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) doesn’t even have a minimum credit score requirement (some lenders, however, do require a score of 640). The United States Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) also has no minimum credit score requirements.&nbsp;

Another problem is that most people are unsure of their credit score in general, and they assume it’s too low to qualify. Here’s the bottom line, though: **84% of people have a credit score that would allow them to buy now.&nbsp;**
