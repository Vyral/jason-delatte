Today I wanted to share some tips on how to handle multiple offers when selling your property.&nbsp;

When you begin the process of selling your home, you have to shift your perception. This is business—you’re selling a product in a large real estate market that will more than likely dictate many of your decisions.&nbsp;

Now, you can choose to ignore the market; however, doing so can be risky and result in regret when you price your home too high in the beginning. This, in turn, could cause your home to stay on the market longer and to sell for less money. **That’s right—the more time your property stays on the market, the less it is valued** because people tend to assume that something is wrong with the listing.

I highly recommend that you listen to your Realtor. They can help you determine your home’s market value and come up with a fair asking price for it. Buyers avoid making offers on overpriced listings because they don’t want to offend the sellers; it goes against human nature to offer way less than asking price.

So, how do you create multiple offer situations?

You’re more likely to attract multiple offers for your home if you price it correctly from the beginning. **A lower asking price can result in buyers being willing to pay more, but the buyers want to make that decision for themselves, usually based on other bids.** Most buyers will run away from the bidding wars if they already think that you’re pricing it over market value.

Once you have multiple offers on your home, it’s now time to make the decision. Now, not all offers are equal. **Even though some of them may offer more money, that doesn’t mean the offer is better.** There are other factors at play, like which type of loan the buyer has, whether or not the buyer has a home of their own to sell before they can buy a new one, and many aspects of the contract itself.

If you would like to speak in more detail about how to generate multiple offers for your home, feel free to contact me. I’d love to speak with you soon.<br>&nbsp;
