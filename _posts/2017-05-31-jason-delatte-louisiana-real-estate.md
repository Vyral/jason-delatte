Today I want to give you quick look at some numbers from our market.

<div class="post-cta">
Want to sell your home? <a href="https://www.thedelattegroup.com/your-home-valuation/" target="_blank">Get a FREE home value report</a><br>
Want to buy a home? <a href="https://www.thedelattegroup.com/listings-search/#/398466887" target="_blank">Search all homes for sale</a>
</div>

How’s our market doing right now? Are homes selling? Are people buying?

**The median home price increased this month to $228,000,** which is up 7.7% from this month last year. That means if you’re a seller, it’s a good idea to get your home on the market now.

I’ve got some news for buyers as well. According to Freddie Mac, **the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 4.2%,** which is an increase from last month’s average rate of 4.15%. So if you are looking to purchase a home, now is the best time to do so.

If you’d like to learn more about how these numbers directly affect you, or if you have any questions about buying or selling a home, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I’m more than happy to help.
