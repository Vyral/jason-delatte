We seem to be entering a buyer's market. What does that mean? I’ll get to that in a second, but first, there are three important trends you need to be aware of.

First, **prices are at an all-time high.** For the past several years, they’ve grown at twice the rate of inflation and faster than most people’s incomes, so it’s not surprising that we’ve reached this level.

Second, **mortgage rates continue to rise.** Current rates are around 4.63%, which is almost a full 1% increase from last year and the highest mark we’ve seen since 2011.

Third, **there’s a decrease in affordability and demand,** which is a result of the first two trends. Specifically, affordability is at a 10-year low. Mortgage applications have also dropped 16% compared to last year.

Now, what does this fundamental market shift mean for you?

**If you’re looking to sell, the time to act is now.** There is still high demand for homes in our area, but over the next several months, the national trends will eventually catch up with our marketplace. If you list soon, you’ll be able to take advantage of these high prices and solid demand. In other words, you can sell quickly and for top dollar.
