When interest rates go up by even just a fraction of a percent, it can affect your ability to buy a home by tens of thousands of dollars.

If you're looking to buy a home, how does a rise in interest rates actually affect you?

Interest rates for homes loans are currently hovering at about 4%, but that might not necessarily be the interest rate you get. The interest rate you get for a home loan is determined by your credit score, income, and debt-to-income ratio.

For example's sake, though, let's say your interest rate is 4% and your lender has approved you for a $250,000 loan. **Every 0.5% increase in interest rates means you lose 10% of your buying power.**

What does that mean, exactly?

In our example, where you are approved for a $250,000 loan and the interest rate increased from 4% to 4.5%, you would then only be approved for a $225,000 loan. That's a significant decrease for such a small rise in interest rate.

As a homebuyer, it's important to grasp how rate fluctuations can impact your buying power. If you're looking to buy your dream home, **now is the time to move while interest rates are so low.** I'm here to help.
