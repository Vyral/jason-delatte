If you are selling your house, how do you know if you should stage it before putting it on the market?

Painting, decluttering, and re-carpeting will probably bring you the cheapest bang for your buck when getting your house ready for the market, but I also recommend staging your property.

Think about it—you see clean, staged homes at the end of every episode of those home-flipping shows that are so popular on TV right now. They all do this because it truly helps them sell the home. The logical thinkers out there might think it’s a waste of your time and money. In real estate, though, **logic may make us think, but emotion makes us act.**

Of course, you want a buyer to act in the form of bringing a great offer to you for your property. If you’d like any tips about staging a home or about buying or selling real estate in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I’d be happy to help!
