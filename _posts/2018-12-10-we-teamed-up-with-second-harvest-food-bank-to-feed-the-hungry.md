What if I told you that one out of every five people in Louisiana are at risk of hunger, and that 25% of children in Orleans Parish alone will go to bed hungry tonight? Both of these statistics are, unfortunately, true—but we can help. A donation of just $1 could provide four hot meals to those in need.<br><br>Our team is passionate about making a change for the better in our community, which is why **we’ve partnered with the Second Harvest Food Bank of New Orleans to help fight hunger.**

We’ve decided to donate a portion of every home sale made by the Delatte Group to Second Harvest Food Bank. Better yet, these donations will be made in the name of whichever client’s home we sold.

**97% of all donations made to the Second Harvest Food Bank go directly back into the community, so we are incredibly excited about this partnership.**

If you have any other questions, would like more information, or are curious about how you can make an impact by volunteering at the Second Harvest Food Bank this holiday season, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon. God Bless.
