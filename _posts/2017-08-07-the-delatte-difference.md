Want to know how to sell your home for top dollar? You’re in luck—I just finished
a book about it.

I recently saw a statistic that said 84% of FSBO (for sale by owner) sellers end up listing with a real estate agent. While my hat is off to the 16% of people who were able to sell their home on their own, my focus is on the 84% who didn’t.

**Your home is probably your single largest asset** and the decision to sell it is one of the biggest financial decisions you’ll ever make. I want to help you make that decision by putting all my knowledge and resources into a book called: “The Delatte Difference: A Step-by-Step Guide to Selling Your Home.”

In this book, I take a detailed look at many aspects of home selling, including the emotional aspect, the most important factors in getting it sold, how to hire agents, how to handle showings, and how to work with offers.

**I’d like to give you a free copy of the book when it’s out in less than a month.** If you’d like one, just give me a call or send me an email today and I’ll make sure I send one out. If you have any other real estate questions, I’d be happy to answer them as well. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
