We’re excited to bring you some new developments that are sure to optimize the way in which we serve your real estate needs.

It’s been a while since my last video. During that time, I’ve been working tirelessly to optimize my business and tailor it to match the growth we’ve been experiencing. In doing so, I’m pleased to announce that my wife, Tee, is now my partner. Together, we are now, officially, The Delatte Group.

Not only have we expanded into a partnership, but we’ve expanded into new markets. We continue to be of service in the Houma and Thibodaux markets, and we are now happily servicing your real estate needs in the New Orleans area as well.

These new developments to our business are a step forward for us in continuing to bring you optimal service and advice. In the last three years, we have helped 91 families either purchase their dream home or sell their home, and we want to keep this trend going.

So, we’re going to be bringing you two videos a month that will interest you and add value to your home. We look forward to bringing you expert advice for all of your real estate needs.
