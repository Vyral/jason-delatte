Have you been toying around with the idea of selling your home, but you just aren’t ready to take the plunge? **I believe there is one major factor that will help you make your decision:** Knowing how to determine what our local housing market is doing.

One question I hear on a weekly basis is, “What’s the difference between a buyer’s market and a seller’s market?” Being in a buyer’s market vs. being in a seller’s market can make a huge difference in the length of time it takes your property to sell, the amount of offers you may get on your home, and how much you can get your home sold for.

**Simply put, a buyer’s market means that there are more homes for sale than there are buyers in the marketplace.** That housing market is more favorable to the buyer.

**A seller’s market is the opposite.** There are more buyers looking for homes than there are homes for sale, making conditions more favorable to sellers. A seller's market can often see full-priced offers and multiple offers.

What kind of market are we in right now? If you really want to know, give me a call or send me an email and I would love to give you the answer. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
