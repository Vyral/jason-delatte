Are you planning on selling your home in 2019? There is some important news you need to hear.

According to the latest home price index, home values appreciated by 4.7% across the country in 2018. Real estate is hyperlocal, and each state’s homes appreciate at different levels, but most parts of the country saw a 2% increase in home values.

How does this help you in listing your home so that it sells for top dollar? As long as Realtors such as myself are armed with the knowledge of experts’ predictions on home appreciation this year, we’ll be able to set the appropriate price for your property from the very beginning of its listing.

**One of the biggest mistakes sellers make is pricing their home too high and then reducing the price later on after they haven’t gotten any offers.** This can make buyers suspicious that there might be something wrong with the home when, in fact, it was just priced too high from the get-go.

Pricing your home correctly from the very beginning is the one of the most challenging parts of listing it, so if you want to know what your home is really worth and where you can price it so that it sells for top dollar, don’t hesitate to give me a call so we can discuss where home values are heading in your area.

As always, if you have any other real estate needs, feel free to reach out to me as well. I’d love to help you.
